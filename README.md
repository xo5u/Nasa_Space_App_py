🌍 Project Name: Air Guardian for Kids

What it does:
This app shows an interactive world map where you can click any country and instantly see the air quality there! It uses real NASA and OpenWeather data to check pollution and show where natural events (like wildfires, volcanoes, or storms) are happening.

How it helps kids:
When a country is clicked, the app asks an AI (language model) to explain the air quality in easy, kid-friendly words — so children can learn if the air is safe to breathe, especially for kids with asthma.

How it works:

🛰️ NASA EONET API: finds active natural events.

🌬️ OpenWeather API: gives live air quality data.

🧠 AI helper: explains results in simple sentences kids understand.

🗺️ Tkinter + Cartopy: makes the interactive world map.

Why it matters:
Kids can learn about the Earth, pollution, and how nature affects our air. It teaches environmental awareness in a fun, interactive way!
